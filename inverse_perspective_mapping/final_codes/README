-	change permissions for the image files using the command
	`sudo chmod -R 777 <Folder Name goes here>
-	use the `ls -ltr` command to get the file list
-	save this file as `filenames_objdis.txt`
-	run the calculate_constants_objdis program to calculate the constants for the taken images
-	run the linear_interpolation_objdis program to interpolate the values which were not calculated
-	repeat above for as many files you like
-	run average_constants program to calculate the average constants values for every single motor location
-	Take picture using the take picture program in the perpend orientation
-	run the calculate_constants_perpend program to calculate the constants for the taken images
-	run the linear_interpolation_perpend program to interpolate the missing values
