-	First take pictures using the take picture program in the objdis orientation
-	Change permissions for the image files using the command
	`sudo chmod -R 777 <Folder Name goes here>
-	Use the `ls -ltr` command to get the file list
-	Save this file as `filenames_objdis.txt`
-	Run the calculate_constants_objdis program to calculate the constants for the taken images
-	Run the linear_interpolation_objdis program to interpolate the values which were not calculated
-	Repeat above for as many files you like
-	Run average_constants program to calculate the average constants values for every single motor location
-	Take picture using the take picture program in the perpend orientation
-	Run the calculate_constants_perpend program to calculate the constants for the taken images
-	Run the linear_interpolation_perpend program to interpolate the missing values

-try distortion correction factor as -6.1e-06
